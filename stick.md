### My Stick Insects

Since a couple of time, I'm growing some Stick Insects. I got one Amman Stick Insect (plus around 30 eggs) and three Australian Stick Insects. They're doing well, many eggs have hatched yet and around 15 sticks are walking around in my terrarium.

See some awesome videos of my sticks.
